# CheesyProgram

//Create a program that will:

// 1.) open a file of cheese prices for six countries (cheeseprice.txt)

// 2.) ask for user input for # of kg of cheese producted

// 3.) calculate total number of containers required to hold the cheese (assuming each contained can hold 2.76 kg of cheese)

// 4.) read in data from the text file (country, price per kg)

// 5.) calculate the total cost

// 6.) output the result to the console

// 7.) output the result into a new file (cheeseprice_formatted.txt)

// this program will utilize <iomanip> to use format manipulators, <fstream> to work with files, <iostream> to work w/input and output
  
// <string> to work with strings
  
// cheese prices obtained from: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_price_rankings?itemId=12
